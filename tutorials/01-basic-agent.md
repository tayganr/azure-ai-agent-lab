# Tutorial 01: Getting Started with Azure AI Agents

[Home](../README.md) - [Next Module >](./02-file-search.md)
   
Welcome to the first tutorial in the Azure AI Agent Service series! In this tutorial, we will guide you through creating a basic AI agent using the Python SDK. This agent will interact with users by responding to a simple query.   
  
## Step 1: Prerequisites  
  
Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have completed the setup as described in the [Technical Prerequisites](../README.md#-technical-prerequisites) section of the README. Key steps include:
  
- **Python Environment**: Python 3.8 or later should be installed and configured.
- **Azure CLI**: Install Azure CLI and log in to your subscription.
- **Repository Setup**: Clone the repository and set up a Python virtual environment.  
- **Install Dependencies**: Use `pip` to install the required packages from `requirements.txt`.
- **Environment Variable**: Ensure the `PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING` is set.

## Step 2: Create the Agent  
   
1. **Write the Python Code:**  
  
   Open your preferred text editor and create a new Python file. Copy and paste the following code into the file:
   
  ```python
    import os  
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient  
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential  
    
    # === Agent Configuration ===  
    AGENT_NAME = "joke-agent"  
    AGENT_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"  
    AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS = (  
        "You are a humorous AI agent. Your task is to generate a joke based on the topic "  
        "provided by the user. Ensure the joke is light-hearted, appropriate, and relevant to the topic."  
    )  
    
    # === User Message Configuration ===
    USER_MESSAGE_CONTENT = "Microsoft"  

    # Load environment variables from .env file  
    load_dotenv()  

    # Initialize the AI Project Client
    project_client = AIProjectClient.from_connection_string(  
        credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),  
        conn_str=os.environ.get("PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING")  
    )  

    # Create an agent  
    agent = project_client.agents.create_agent(  
        model=AGENT_MODEL,  
        name=AGENT_NAME,  
        instructions=AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS,  
        tools=[]  
    )  

    # Create a thread  
    thread = project_client.agents.create_thread()  

    # Add a message to the thread  
    message = project_client.agents.create_message(  
        thread_id=thread.id,  
        role="user",  
        content=USER_MESSAGE_CONTENT  
    )

    # Run the agent  
    run = project_client.agents.create_and_process_run(  
        thread_id=thread.id,  
        assistant_id=agent.id  
    )  

    # Retrieve and print the agent's response  
    messages = project_client.agents.list_messages(thread_id=thread.id)  
    last_msg = messages.get_last_text_message_by_role("assistant")  
    print(last_msg.text.value)  

    # Clean up resources
    project_client.agents.delete_agent(agent.id)  
  ```  
   
## Step 3: Run Your Code
   
2. **Execute the Python Script:**  
  
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your Python file is saved, and run the script:  
  
   ```bash  
   python your_script_name.py  
   ```  
  
   Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual filename of your script.  
   
3. **Observe the Output:**  
  
   - As the script executes, it will create an agent, set up a conversation thread, and send a user message.  
   - The agent will process the message and respond based on its instructions.  
   - Example output in your terminal:  
  
     ```  
    Why did Microsoft go to therapy?

    Because it had too many issues to resolve!
     ```  
  
   Note: The agent's response may vary as it is generated by the language model.  
   
## Understanding the Code  
   
- **Agent Creation:**  
  
  The agent is created with minimal setup, using a model and basic instructions. No additional tools are used in this simple example.  
   
- **Thread and Message:**  
  
  A conversation thread is established where the user can send messages. In this tutorial, we send a single message.  
   
- **Agent Run:**  
  
  The agent processes the thread's messages and responds. The status of the run and the agent's response are printed to the console.  
   
- **Cleanup:**  
  
  After the interaction, the agent is deleted to clean up resources.  
   
## Next Steps  
   
Congratulations! You've successfully created a basic Azure AI agent that can respond to user inquiries. This foundational setup prepares you for more advanced tutorials where you'll integrate tools and extend your agent's capabilities.
