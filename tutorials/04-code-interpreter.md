# Tutorial 04: Enhancing Interactivity: Implementing the Code Interpreter Tool    
  
Welcome to the fourth tutorial in the Azure AI Agent Service series! In this tutorial, you will learn how to integrate the Code Interpreter tool into your AI agent. This tool will enable your agent to perform complex computations and generate visualizations based on provided data files.    
  
## Step 1: Prerequisites  
  
Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have completed the setup as described in the [Technical Prerequisites](../README.md#-technical-prerequisites) section of the README. Key steps include:
  
- **Python Environment**: Python 3.8 or later should be installed and configured.
- **Azure CLI**: Install Azure CLI and log in to your subscription.
- **Repository Setup**: Clone the repository and set up a Python virtual environment.  
- **Install Dependencies**: Use `pip` to install the required packages from `requirements.txt`.
- **Environment Variable**: Ensure the `PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING` is set.
  
## Step 2: Write the Python Code    
  
1. **Create a New Python File:**    
   Open your preferred text editor and create a new Python file. Copy and paste the following code into the file:    
  
```python    
import os    
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient    
from azure.ai.projects.models import CodeInterpreterTool, FilePurpose    
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential    
  
# Step 1: Create an Azure AI Client from a connection string    
project_client = AIProjectClient.from_connection_string(    
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),     
    conn_str=os.environ["PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING"]    
)    
  
# Step 2: Upload a file    
file = project_client.agents.upload_file_and_poll(    
    file_path="./documents/quarterly_results.csv",  # Specify the path to your local CSV file    
    purpose=FilePurpose.AGENTS    
)    
print(f"Uploaded file, file ID: {file.id}")    
  
# Step 3: Create an agent with the code interpreter tool    
code_interpreter = CodeInterpreterTool(file_ids=[file.id])    
  
# Create agent with code interpreter tool and tools_resources    
agent = project_client.agents.create_agent(    
    model="gpt-4o-mini",  # Ensure to use a supported model    
    name="my-agent",    
    instructions="You are a helpful agent.",    
    tools=code_interpreter.definitions,    
    tool_resources=code_interpreter.resources,    
)    
print(f"Created agent, ID: {agent.id}")    
  
# Step 4: Create a thread and a user message    
thread = project_client.agents.create_thread()    
print(f"Created thread, thread ID: {thread.id}")    
  
# Create a user message that triggers the code interpreter tool    
message = project_client.agents.create_message(    
    thread_id=thread.id,    
    role="user",    
    content=("Could you please create a bar chart in the TRANSPORTATION sector for the operating "    
             "profit from the uploaded CSV file and provide the file to me?")    
)    
print(f"Created message, message ID: {message.id}")    
  
# Step 5: Create and execute a run    
run = project_client.agents.create_and_process_run(    
    thread_id=thread.id,    
    assistant_id=agent.id    
)    
print(f"Run finished with status: {run.status}")    
  
if run.status == "failed":    
    # Check if you got "Rate limit is exceeded.", then you want to get more quota    
    print(f"Run failed: {run.last_error}")    
  
# Step 6: Delete the original file from the agent to free up space    
project_client.agents.delete_file(file.id)    
print("Deleted file")    
  
# Step 7: Print the messages from the agent    
messages = project_client.agents.list_messages(thread_id=thread.id)    
  
# Step 8: Download files generated by the code interpreter    
# Retrieve the last message from the assistant    
last_msg = messages.get_last_message_by_role("assistant")    
  
if last_msg:    
    # Retrieve the text messages from the last message    
    text_messages = last_msg.text_messages  # Get all text messages in the last assistant message    
  
    # Print the content of the last text message    
    if text_messages:    
        print(f"Last Message: {text_messages[-1].text.value}")    
    # Check for file path annotations    
    for file_path_annotation in last_msg.file_path_annotations:    
        file_path = file_path_annotation.file_path    
        file_id = file_path['file_id']    
        project_client.agents.save_file(file_id=file_id, file_name='chart.png', target_dir='./documents')    
        print(f"Saved file: {file_id} as chart.png")    
```    
  
## Step 3: Run Your Code    
  
2. **Execute the Python Script:**    
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your Python file is saved, and run the script:    
  
```bash    
python your_script_name.py    
```    
  
Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual filename of your script.    
  
3. **Observe the Output:**    
   - As the script executes, it will upload a CSV file, create an agent configured with the Code Interpreter tool, set up a conversation thread, and send a user message.    
   - The agent will process the message, generate a bar chart based on the CSV data, and provide the chart as a file.    
   - You should see output similar to:    
  
```    
Uploaded file, file ID: assistant-shHyO9eLVrOWUuu3HXx8Fl74
Created agent, ID: asst_4OLr0Q2mlAyyMtayMz7wcYBE
Created thread, thread ID: thread_g6HnVloa1BKPU7CeVhXrGcZa
Created message, message ID: msg_JiLeLKrQZxGFGt3JP4RBTXAD
Run finished with status: RunStatus.COMPLETED
Deleted file
Last Message: The bar chart showing the operating profit in the Transportation sector has been created successfully.
Saved file: assistant-ePasV2aVfwCjmYkPyTbUzGaF as chart.png
```    
  
## Understanding the Code    
  
- **File Upload:** The code uploads a CSV file to be used by the Code Interpreter tool for generating visualizations.    
- **Code Interpreter Tool Initialization:** The code initializes the Code Interpreter tool with the uploaded file's ID, allowing the agent to perform computations and generate outputs.    
- **Agent Creation:** The agent is created with instructions and integrated with the Code Interpreter tool.    
- **Thread and Message:** A conversation thread is established where the user can send messages. In this example, the user requests a bar chart.    
- **Agent Run:** The agent processes the thread's messages and generates the requested chart.    
- **Cleanup:** After the interaction, the original file is deleted to free up resources, and the generated chart is saved locally.
