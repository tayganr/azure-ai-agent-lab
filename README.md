# Azure AI Agent Service Lab

## What is Azure AI Agent Service

[Azure AI Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/overview) is a fully managed platform designed to help developers create, deploy, and scale AI agents with ease, without the need to manage underlying compute and storage resources. By utilising advanced language models, it simplifies the process of building AI agents that can answer questions, perform tasks, and automate workflows. The service offers seamless integration with various tools and data sources, enabling agents to access and interact with real-world data. It provides features like automatic tool calling, secure data management, and extensive data integrations, making it ideal for enterprise applications requiring enhanced security and flexibility.

## Concepts
   
| **Concept** | **Explanation** |  
|-------------|-----------------|  
| ü§ñ **Agent**   | An AI-driven microservice that uses models and tools to perform tasks, answer questions, and automate workflows. Think of it as a virtual assistant powered by AI. |  
| üßµ **Thread**  | A conversation session between an agent and a user. It stores messages and manages conversation history, ensuring the content fits within the model's context. |  
| ‚úâÔ∏è **Message** | A piece of communication within a thread, which can be text, images, or other files, created by either the agent or the user. |  
| üöÄ **Run**     | The activation of an agent to perform tasks based on the thread's messages. During a run, the agent processes the information and may call models and tools to achieve its objectives. |  
| üìù **Run Step**     | A detailed list of actions taken by the agent during a run. Each step shows how the agent interacts with tools, models, and messages to reach its final outcome. Examining run steps helps you understand the agent's decision-making process. |  

Based on the provided context, here's an explanation of how pricing works for the Azure AI Agent Service:  
   
## ü§î Technical Prerequisites  
   
1. **Azure Subscription**:  
   - You need an active Azure subscription. You can create one for free if you don't have it.  
   
2. **Python Environment**:  
   - Install Python 3.8 or later. Ensure your Python environment is set up and properly configured.  
   
3. **Azure AI Developer Role**:  
   - Assign the Azure AI Developer RBAC role at the Hub or Project level to access and manage Azure AI services.  
   
4. **Azure CLI**:  
   - Install the Azure CLI. It is used to log in to your Azure subscription.  
   
5. **Python Virtual Environment**:  
   - Create a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies cleanly:  
     ```bash  
     python -m venv myenv  
     ```  
   - Activate the virtual environment:  
     - On Windows:  
       ```bash  
       myenv\Scripts\activate  
       ```  
     - On macOS/Linux:  
       ```bash  
       source myenv/bin/activate  
       ```  
   
6. **Python Packages**:  
   - Install necessary Python packages using pip and a requirements file:  
     ```bash  
     pip install -r requirements.txt  
     ```  
   
7. **Connection String**:  
   - Create a connection string using information from your Azure AI project. This includes `HostName`, `AzureSubscriptionId`, `ResourceGroup`, and `ProjectName`. Set this as an environment variable `PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING`:  
  
     - **For PowerShell**:  
       ```powershell  
       $env:PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING="your-connection-string-here"  
       ```  
  
     - **For Bash (macOS/Linux)**:  
       ```bash  
       export PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING="your-connection-string-here"  
       ```  
  
     - **For Windows Command Prompt**:  
       ```cmd  
       set PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING="your-connection-string-here"  
       ```  
  
   - You can obtain the connection string from the Azure AI Foundry portal.  
   
8. **Login to Azure**:  
   - Use the Azure CLI to log in to your Azure subscription:  
     ```bash  
     az login  
     ```  
   
With these steps completed, you should be ready to run code associated with the Azure AI Agent Service on a new machine.
